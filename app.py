# Variables: we use variables to store data in computer's memory.

# when we run this program, Python interpreter will allocate some memory and stor this number(1000) in that memory space. then it will have this variable reference, that memory location. So this variable is just like a label for that memory location. we can use this variable or this label anywhere in our program to get access to that memory location and the data stored there.
students_count = 1000
print(students_count)

# What kind of data can we store in computer's memory?
# - built in primitive types: Primitive types can be numbers, booleans and strings. for example:
students_count = 2000  # numbers with decimal point
rating = 4.99  # float or floating point number
course_name = "Python Programming"  # strings
is_published = False  # boolean values can be False or True

# Python is a case sensitive language, which means lowercase and uppercase character have different meanings so boolean values should always start with capital letters and false or FALSE is not accepted boolean values in Python.
