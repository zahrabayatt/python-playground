# In python we have three types of numbers:
x = 1  # integers
x = 1.1  # floats
x = 1 + 2j  # complex numbers

# For all these types of numbers we have the standard arithmetic operations that we have in math:
print(10 + 3)  # addition
print(10 - 3)  # subtraction
print(10 * 3)  # multiplication
print(10 / 3)  # division - we got a floating number
print(10 // 3)  # division - we got a integer number
print(10 % 3)  # modulus
print(10 ** 3)  # power

# For all these operators, we have a special operator called Augmented Assignment Operator:
x = 10
x += 3  # It is equal to x = x + 3
